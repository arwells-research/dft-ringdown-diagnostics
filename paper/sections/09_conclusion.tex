\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented a $\Sigma_2$-motivated, operator-theoretic diagnostic framework for assessing
ringdown mode legitimacy in generally non-normal relaxation systems. By combining
biorthogonal modal reconstructions with a pseudospectral isolation criterion for ringdown
onset and a closure-energy monotonicity test, the framework distinguishes genuine physical
relaxation channels from early-time pseudospectral reconstruction artifacts. Synthetic
NR-like demonstrations show how additional overtones may improve early-time waveform fits
while violating the legitimacy criterion, consistent with their role prior to spectral
isolation. The proposed diagnostics are computationally tractable via reduced-order
resolvent estimates and are naturally complementary to existing mismatch- and Bayesian
model-selection approaches, particularly in high-SNR regimes where systematic effects
dominate.
